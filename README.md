# Installation
Run the following commands in order:  

    git clone https://github.com/Acaki/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    sh install_all.sh
    or
    sh install_vimrc_only.sh
    
Your existing dotfiles will be moved to dotfiles_old directory if you choose to install all, and your existing .vimrc file will be renamed to .vimrc.old if you choose to install vimrc only.
